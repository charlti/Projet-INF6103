Creation of a simulation of a critical infrastructure with SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)

The architecture is based on a SCADA system (ScadaBR) overlooking a PLC which sends controls to the trafic lights. 
Then we attacked the simulation to showcase the vulnerabilites of the MODBUS protocol. 
To finish with, we implemented some defenses to prevent our previous attack.
